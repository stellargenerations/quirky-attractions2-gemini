  <h3>The Story of Cadillac Ranch</h3>
  <div class="article-content">
    <p>Cadillac Ranch stands as one of America's most iconic roadside art installations, appearing in countless photographs, films, and road trip memories since its creation in 1974.</p>
<h2>The Eccentric Origins</h2>
<p>This unusual monument was created by the art collective Ant Farm, led by Chip Lord, Hudson Marquez, and Doug Michels. The installation was commissioned by eccentric helium millionaire Stanley Marsh 3, known for his love of unusual public art projects around his hometown of Amarillo.</p>
<h2>An Ever-Changing Canvas</h2>
<p>What makes Cadillac Ranch particularly special is its interactive nature. Visitors are encouraged to bring spray paint and add their own marks to the vehicles. This means the installation is constantly changing, with layers upon layers of colorful graffiti accumulating over the decades.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It's a monument to the rise and fall of the tailfin and America's obsession with the road.&quot; - Chip Lord, co-creator</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Cultural Icon</h2>
<p>The ten Cadillacs, ranging from 1949 to 1963 models, are buried nose-down in the Texas Panhandle soil at the same angle as the Great Pyramid of Giza. Since its installation, Cadillac Ranch has inspired countless other automobile art pieces across America and has been referenced in songs, films, and literature.</p>
<p>Though Stanley Marsh 3 passed away in 2014 and the Ant Farm collective disbanded long ago, Cadillac Ranch continues to stand as a testament to American car culture, artistic expression, and the allure of the open road.</p>
